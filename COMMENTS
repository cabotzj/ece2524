You had some redundant imports and an unneccessary import of exit.

Also, you were replacing all the digits with the grade, not just the number itself (so you would get double replacements).

To make it more in line with the UNIX philosophy, I changed the code so that it will put the restul in a list and return that list. This way you do not always print out hte data, you can do w/e you want with it.
